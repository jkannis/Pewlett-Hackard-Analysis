- Overall, 30% of Pewlett-Hackard's workforce will be retirement-eligible.

## Summary
- There are seven roles that will be depleted from the retirement-eligible employees departures.
- There are more than enough qualified retirement-ready employees to mentor the mentorship-eligible employees.
### Additional Data Recommendations
1. Identifying which departments, not just titles, the departing employees work in may identify particular areas that might be hit hardest by retirements.
2. A query that lists the retirement-eligible titles broken down by retirement year may help the client plan more strategically for filling empty positions.
